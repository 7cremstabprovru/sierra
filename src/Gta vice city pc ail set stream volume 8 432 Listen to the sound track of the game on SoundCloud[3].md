# How to fix the error "The procedure entry point \_Ail\_set\_stream\_volume@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library mss32.dll" when running GTA Vice City on Windows 10
  
GTA Vice City is a popular open-world game that was released in 2002. However, some users may encounter an error message when trying to run the game on Windows 10. The error message says "The procedure entry point \_Ail\_set\_stream\_volume@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library mss32.dll". This error prevents the game from launching and can be frustrating for fans of the game.
  
Fortunately, there are some possible solutions to fix this error and enjoy GTA Vice City on Windows 10. Here are some of them:
 
**DOWNLOAD â‡” [https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2uyaLH](https://fienislile.blogspot.com/?download=2uyaLH)**


  
1. Enable Direct Play. Direct Play is a legacy feature that is required by some older games to run on newer operating systems. To enable Direct Play, go to Programs and Features > Turn Windows Features On or Off. Scroll down to and enable Legacy Components & Direct Play. Restart your computer and try running the game again.[^2^]
2. Use a noCD fix/hack. Some versions of GTA Vice City may have a DRM (digital rights management) protection that causes compatibility issues with Windows 10. To bypass this protection, you can use a noCD fix/hack that replaces the original game executable with a modified one that does not require the game disc or mss32.dll file. You can find various noCD fixes/hacks online, but be careful to download them from trusted sources and scan them for viruses before using them.[^2^]
3. Reinstall or update mss32.dll file. The mss32.dll file is a library file that contains audio functions used by some games and applications. If this file is missing, corrupted, or outdated, it may cause the error message to appear. To fix this, you can try reinstalling or updating the mss32.dll file from a reliable source. You can either download the file from the internet or copy it from another computer that has GTA Vice City installed. Make sure to place the file in the same folder as the game executable or in the System32 folder.[^3^]

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you fix the error and run GTA Vice City on Windows 10 without any problems. If you still have issues, you can contact the game developer or publisher for further support.
  
GTA Vice City is not the only game that may have compatibility issues with Windows 10. Some other older games may also require some tweaks or fixes to run smoothly on the latest operating system. Here are some general tips to improve your gaming experience on Windows 10:

- Run the game in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode is a feature that allows you to run a program as if it was on a different version of Windows. To use this feature, right-click on the game executable or shortcut and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for". Choose the Windows version that matches the game's requirements. You can also check other options such as "Run as administrator" or "Disable fullscreen optimizations" if needed.
- Update your drivers and software. Sometimes, outdated or incompatible drivers and software can cause errors or performance issues with games. To avoid this, make sure to update your drivers and software regularly. You can use Windows Update or Device Manager to check for updates for your hardware and software. You can also visit the manufacturer's website or use a third-party tool to download and install the latest drivers and software for your devices.
- Adjust your graphics settings. Some games may have high graphics requirements that may not be suitable for your system. To improve your game performance, you can try lowering your graphics settings in the game options or in the graphics card control panel. You can also disable unnecessary features such as anti-aliasing, shadows, or motion blur. Alternatively, you can upgrade your graphics card or system to meet the game's recommended specifications.

With these tips, you should be able to enjoy GTA Vice City and other older games on Windows 10 without any hassle. Happy gaming!
