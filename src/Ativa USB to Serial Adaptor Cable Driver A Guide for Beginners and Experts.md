### Using a third-party driver from the internet

However, you need to be careful when downloading drivers from unknown sources as they might contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer.
 
To use this method, follow these steps:

1. Open Device Manager and right-click on your Ativa USB to serial adaptor cable. Select Properties and then go to the Details tab.
2. Look at the Hardware Ids property and note down the value that starts with "USB\\VID" and ends with "&REV". For example, if you see "USB\\VID\_0409&PID\_005A&REV\_0100", note down "USB\\VID\_0409&PID\_005A".
3. Do a web search for this value and look for a website that offers a driver download for your device. For example, you can search for "USB\\VID\_0409&PID\_005A driver". Make sure the website is trustworthy and reputable before downloading anything.
4. Download the driver file and extract it if it is compressed. You should see an INF file and possibly some other files such as DLLs or EXEs.
5. Plug your Ativa USB to serial adaptor cable into a USB port on your computer.
6. Open Device Manager again and right-click on your device. Select Update Driver Software and then Browse my computer for driver 8cf37b1e13
