Once you have installed CADKEY 98 on your computer, you can start using it to create and edit 2D and 3D models. Here are some basic tips to get you started:

- To launch CADKEY 98, go to Start > Programs > CADKEY 98 > CADKEY 98. You will see a user interface with a menu bar, a toolbar, a status bar, and four viewports. Each viewport shows a different perspective of your model: front, top, right, and isometric.
- To create a new model, go to File > New. You will be prompted to choose a template and a unit system. You can use the default settings or customize them according to your preferences.
- To draw 2D shapes, use the tools in the Draw menu or the toolbar. You can draw lines, arcs, circles, rectangles, polygons, splines, and more. You can also use the Sketcher tool to draw freehand sketches.
- To edit 2D shapes, use the tools in the Edit menu or the toolbar. You can move, copy, rotate, scale, mirror, trim, extend, fillet, chamfer, offset, and more. You can also use the Modify tool to edit the shape's vertices and segments.
- To create 3D solids, use the tools in the Solid menu or the toolbar. You can extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, blend, shell, and more. You can also use the Boolean tool to combine or subtract solids.
- To edit 3D solids, use the tools in the Solid Edit menu or the toolbar. You can move face, rotate face, scale face, delete face, add face, fillet edge, chamfer edge, shell solid, and more. You can also use the Modify tool to edit the solid's faces and edges.
- To create 3D surfaces, use the tools in the Surface menu or the toolbar. You can extrude curve, revolve curve, sweep curve along curve or surface edge (rail), loft curves (skin), blend curves (blend), offset surface (thicken), and more. You can also use the Freeform tool to create organic shapes by manipulating control points.
- To edit 3D surfaces, use the tools in the Surface Edit menu or the toolbar. You can move control point (CV), rotate control point (CV), scale control point (CV), delete control point (CV), add control point (CV), move surface edge (boundary), rotate surface edge (boundary), scale surface edge (boundary), delete surface edge (boundary), add surface edge (boundary), trim surface by curve or surface (cut), extend surface by curve or surface (stretch), fillet surface edge (round), chamfer surface edge (bevel), stitch surfaces (join), and more. You can also use the Modify tool to edit the surface's control points and edges.
- To view your model in different ways, use the tools in the View menu or the toolbar. You can zoom in/out/fit/window/previous/next/selected/all/viewports/active viewport/locked viewport/unlocked viewport/parallel/perspective/ortho/isometric/user defined/view from/view to/view along/view normal/view up/view down/view left/view right/view front/view back/view top/view bottom/rotate/twist/pan/walk/fly/orbit/dolly/roll/pitch/yaw/reset view/save view/restore view/show/hide/shade/wireframe/render/light/material/texture/background/grid/snap/crosshair/cursor/coordinate system/status bar/menu bar/tool bar/help bar.
- To save your model as a file, go to File > Save or Save As. You will be prompted to choose a file name and a file type. You can save your model as a CADKEY Part File (.prt) or as other formats such as IGES (.igs), STEP (.stp), STL (.stl), DXF (.dxf), DWG (.dwg), VRML (.wrl), JPEG (.jpg), BMP (.bmp), TIFF (.tif), PNG (.png), etc.
