- Unlock all weapons and hidden console commands, which give you access to more options and customization.
- Speed hack, which increases your movement speed.

## How to Avoid Getting Banned?

Here are some tips to avoid getting banned:

- Don't be too obvious with your cheating. Don't kill everyone in sight or use unrealistic settings that make you look like a robot.
- Don't brag about your cheating or insult other players. Be respectful and humble.
- Don't use the same name or CD key on different servers. Use the spoofer feature to change them frequently.
