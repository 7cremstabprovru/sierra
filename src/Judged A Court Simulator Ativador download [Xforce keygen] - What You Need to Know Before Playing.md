He wanted to create a game that simulates the real-life challenges and dilemmas of being a judge. He also wanted to make a game that is fun and educational for both lawyers and non-lawyers.
 
Judged: A Court Simulator is a game that offers a unique and immersive experience of being a judge. The game is still in early access, but it has a lot of potential to grow and improve. The game might not be perfect, but it is definitely worth checking out if you are interested in law and justice.
